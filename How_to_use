First launch the server by running the Auction.java file in src/server/

The commands to type as a client are in the files in Commands/
    CommandLogin  : the commands available when first running a client
    CommandBuyer  : the commands available when logged in as a buyer
    CommandSeller : the commands available when logged in as a seller
    CommandAdmin  : the commands available when logged in as the auctioneer
There can be as many buyers and sellers connected at the same time but only one auctioneer.
Sellers keep adding sales as they wish and with a time limit.
Buyers keep bidding on the sales till the time runs out.
When the time runs out for a sale, the buyer whose bid is the highest buys it.
The auction house represented by the auctioneer takes a percentage of any purchase and selling that occurs.
